Hi! Thanks for visiting my nascent webpage. I'm still figuring out how to fill this with useful info, but in the meantime I'd like to mention a few things about myself:

- I'm currently a PhD student in the Weinberg Theory Group at UT Austin, with my research focusing on quantum effects in the early universe
- I'm fascinated by mathematical modeling and its application to basic science and real-world problem solving
- My favorite pastimes include vegetarian cooking, smoothie-making, basketball analysis, and reading longform articles

### My story

Details to come soon!
